# FINDING MAXIMUM USED WORDS
 I have Used callback functions to filter, sort and map arrays and objects in JavaScript
 I have Used string manipulation functions.
 In this project, I have started with a given string that contains a number of words. 
 Then, define the number of times each word appears in the given text.
 After that point, i have seen what the top three words used are.
 I have used split function to split the words in the single array.
 I have implement for each loop in this project to fetch the item in the array
 Then i have used splice function to get the top three words in an array.
